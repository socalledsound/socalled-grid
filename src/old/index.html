It began with a fascination with the sound of electricity, which, in America, is pitched at or near 60hz.  This seemed like an excellent entry point for understanding and exploring drones.  I searched in my sound effects library for 'hum' and found a great deal of sound that mostly sounded quite good together.  There were, however, a great many files which had the term 'human' in them, and were quite out of place in this landscape of electrons.  And so, I changed the search term to 'hum -human', and I had a title for the piece.  'Hum -Human was originally performed alongside Douglas Kahn during a reading from his text 'Earth Sound Earth Signal'."/></li>

            In this piece, computer, projector, audio amplifier and projection screen are all brought together into a single sculptural form, which is suspended from the ceiling. The sounds are output through a resonator attached to the plexiglass screen, which is also the surface onto which the titles of the sounds are projected. The resonator, framed by a circle of light, becomes, in a sense, the main character of an absurb little drama which has no end and no beginning, aaside from the beginning and end of the exhibition.

Mobilizing specific historical records as memories which flash up in moments of danger, the video addresses the expansion and intensification of secrecy practices in the current climate of heightened security. A former CIA source recounts his disappearance through shredded classified documents that were painstakingly reassembled by radical fundamentalist students in Iran in 1979. A CIA film- recorded in 1974 but unacknowledged until 1992--documents the burial at sea of six Soviet sailors, in a ceremony which collapses Cold War antagonisms in a moment of death and honor. Images pertaining to a publicly acknowledged but top secret U.S. missile strike in Yemen in 2002 are the source of a concluding reflection on the role of documents in the constitution of the dynamic of knowing and not knowing. These records are punctuated by fragments of interviews with information management officials from various federal agencies, who distinguish between 'real' and 'protocol' secrets, explain what it means to 'neither confirm nor deny' the existence of records on a given subject, and clarify the process of separating classified from unclassified information."/></li>

Shot in 2005/06 in Damascus, Syria, the work combines fiction and non-fiction. Each section of the piece--the chronicle of a building in downtown Damascus, an interview with a dissident intellectual, documentation of an equestrian event, the fever dream of a U.S. policymaker, and a portrait of a Qur'an school for young girls--offers a different perspective on what might come to pass in a place where people live between the competing forces of a repressive regime, a growing conservative Islamic movement, and intense pressure from the United States.
