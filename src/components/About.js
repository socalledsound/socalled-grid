                Hi!  My name is Chris Kubick and this is a somewhat random collection of some of
                the projects, web and otherwise, that I've made over the years.</p>  
                <p>When I was 15 I thought for sure I'd be a writer, when I was 25 I had somehow become a sound designer,
                designing ambiences and sound effects in LA, for classics like 'Flatland', a tv services
                that featured Dennis Hopper as a time traveling kung fu warrior in 25th century Shanghai.
                And also, Futurama, and a few other watchable things.</p>  
                <p>Somewhere along the way I got a little
                bored with that and starting coding sounds, and started having museum shows.</p> 
                <p>Before I knew it I was kind of obsessed with coding.  Now I'm kinda sorta expert not only in the web languages -- HTML/CSS/Javascript,
                --  but also pretty good in Python, C, and GLSL.  And I still write some stuff in my first love, SuperCollider, too.</p> 
                <p>For the last decade, I've been a freelance web and app developer.  I also teach creative coding at UC Berkeley and SFAI, 
                    as well as the occasional guest stint elsewhere.  And, I teach React and other web tech to aspiring developers through my own site 
                    <a href="https://www.socalledsidefx.com">socalledsidefx.com</a>.
                </p>
                <p>I code web sites, games, data visualization, microcontrollers and audio apps, but if I have a particular specialty, it's building
                    dynamic web apps using React, Redux web audio and SVG.</p>  
                <p>I also built a sailboat that makes sounds!</p>    
                <p>If you want to chat about sound effects, coding audio for the web,
                    or other even more interesting things, or if you want to come hear some sounds on my boat, 
                    feel free to drop me a line via the contact link in the header!  
            </p>
