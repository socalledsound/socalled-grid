                Hi!  My name is Chris Kubick and this is a somewhat random collection of some of
                the projects, web and otherwise, that I've made over the years.</p>  
                <p>When I was 15 I thought for sure I'd be a writer, when I was 25 I had somehow become a sound designer,
                designing ambiences and sound effects in LA, for classics like 'Flatland', a tv services
                that featured Dennis Hopper as a time traveling kung fu warrior in 25th century Shanghai.
                And also, Futurama, and a few other watchable things.</p>  
                <p>Somewhere along the way I got a little
                bored with that and starting coding sounds, and started having museum shows.</p>  
                <p>Nowadays I mostly
                build websites, often with a strong audio component.  My favorite tools are web audio, webGL and SVG,
                alongside a variety of javascript frameworks, but mostly people hire me to build elegant interfaces
                using React/Redux and svg.</p>  
                <p>If you want to chat about sound effects, or coding audio for the web,
                or something else interesting, drop me a line via the contact link in the header!  
            </p>
