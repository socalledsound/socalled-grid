This seemed like an excellent entry point for understanding and exploring drones.  I searched in my sound effects library for 'hum' and found a great deal of sound that mostly sounded quite good together.  There were, however, a great many files which had the term 'human' in them, and were quite out of place in this landscape of electrons.  And so, I changed the search term to 'hum -human', and I had a title for the piece.  made with the SuperCollider programming language",
